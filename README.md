## Portfolio Website Project Description

This is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my work, skills, and contact information.
It is structured into four main pages:

- Home: The landing page with a welcome message, profile picture, and social media links.
- About: A section that introduces who I am, my background, skills, and professional goals.
- Projects: A collection of featured projects, each with descriptions, technologies used, and links to source code or live demos.
- Contact: A page that allows visitors to get in touch via a contact form or direct links (email, social media, etc.).

The site is responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
All content is configurable from the config.js file, including personal information, project details, and social links.
